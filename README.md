# Makers Academy Challenge - Instacam

Instacam is your photo sharing social media platform. Snap pictures then upload them for all to see! If you see a picture you like, like it so that person knows!... This is a bare bones trustworthy ruby on rails clone of Instagram. The idea was to learn about backend development for Rails.

## Learning Outcomes

This vanilla rails project taught me the fundamentals of the MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER (MVC) paradigm. I also learnt how to integrate authorisation gems and external endpoints (AWS). I found it superbly satisfying to refactor bits and bobs of tests with helper methods and quickly realised how easy it is to write long chunks of code that work but aren't necessarily optimum.


## Personal goals

- HTML/CSS(improve)
- GeoLocation Capability
- Tagging capability
